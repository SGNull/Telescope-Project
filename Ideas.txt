These are some ideas that I come up with during the project that are somewhat out of the way, but still feasible enough to be written down.


A syntax enforcer & better error checker for TASL V3+.

A light compiler with support for simple loops, function calls, variables, and +=, -=, etc. style operations.

Parallel processing with dual read memory.

Integration of the QT Project with the Telescope Computer? QPU as a coprocessor? How would this even work? (Not sure about this after QPUX)

VRAM using a TLB microcontroller which can be controlled via some I/O device (possibly part of the internal expansion IO group).

With networking: simple (not machine learning) AI which moves data over the network using networking software that receives updates, and they randomly decide to install that update or not.

Computer defect simulation by randomly deleting a line from a random hardware file it's dependent on (and hoping it still loads properly. Probably use some kind of regex to delete stuff)
