/ This is a test to make sure that I/O interactions work.
/ It takes a number from I/O and does a few operations on it.

/ I/O specs for this test:
/   No IOP controls, but IOP output probe
/   I/O goes to one register
/   User-controlled SR flip-flop for write input
/   If the CPU reads, write should be turned off
/   Read input should be !write

/ The program waits for a write signal
/ Multiplies the given number by 3
/ Waits for a reading signal
/ Then writes the result to I/O and to IOP

%OUTTO IOTest.tlo%

/ Wait for a writing signal
#WaitWrite
JIF PNW >WaitWrite

/ Multiply the given number by 3
MOV RG0 IO
ALI MUL RG0 0x3

/ Wait for a reading signal
#WaitRead
JIF PNR >WaitRead

/ Write the result to I/O
MOV IO RG0

/ Write the result to IOP
ALI SLB RG0 0xB
ALU OR FLG RG0

/ Done
HLT
