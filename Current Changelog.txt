LATEST CHANGES:

Now (), {}, and [] count as foldable sections of code.

Resolved #52: Took forever to realize that at some point in development, N++ changed how it handled the function list. Functions can be defined in two ways in TASL. The first way is a slight modification of what we're already doing; instead of (#MyFunc \n .... \n ), do {#MyFunc \n .... \n }. The second way is, in my opinion, much more elegant and will no-doubt be more familiar to many coders: #MyFunc = { \n ... \n }. You can also put %arg1, arg2, arg3, ...% between #MyFunc and = to specify what arguments it takes. You could also add \->output after = { to specify what the output is.

	To set up the function list, copy the tasl_function.xml file into your N++ MAIN DIRECTORY, not necessarily the %APPDATA% one. Specifically, copy it into the \Function List\ directory. While still in \Function List\, add these two lines to the overrideMap.xml file:
			<association id= "tasl_function.xml"	userDefinedLangName="TASL"/>
			<association id= "tasl_function.xml"	ext=".tasl"/>
	The second one is what activated it for me, but the first one should also work. I'd put both in, just to be safe.

Added an important step to the "Setting Up the Mini-IDE" section of the NtK guide.

Updating the important characters list image.
