LATEST CHANGES:

Fixed issues with custom n++ macros that the last commit caused.

Fixed issue with the Python assembler not handling directories with periods in them. Actually, in some spots, it wasn't really handling directories at all. Not sure how this didn't break sooner to be honest.

Resolved #26: Added support for negative numbers to both the Python and self-assembler.

Split test files into two seperate directories: Basic Tests, and Advanced Tests.

Created the Negative Numbers Test.
