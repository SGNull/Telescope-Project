LATEST CHANGES:

I'm calling this TBOS v2.1 given the important underlying changes that have occurred in this commit and the last. I also changed the v2.1 milestone to "Complete" since I'm not sure what version that will be.

Fixed bug where UnblockAll would not decrement SoftBlockCount correctly.

Fixed bug where Dispatcher improperly checked SemAdd (it was just looking at (pseudo-)random values).

Added ProcSupportList. This is optimization eliminates the need for common chunks of code that deal with processes, and consequently should speed up the OS quite a bit. Not to be confused with support structures, this is a list of process metadata that is meant to *support* process management. It's very easy to access, very easy to update, and very small. I've implemented a few optimizations that I had in mind (most noteably in the Dispatcher and Terminate functions), but this also opens the door for future optimizations (should other major inefficiencies be discovered).

Added support list optimization details to the Optimization Notes file (probably going to keep this file for future versions of TBOS, but I'll have to find a way to standardize everything when new tests are used).
