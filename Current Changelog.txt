LATEST CHANGES:

Changelog is no longer being cleared after commits, because it should be an actual changelog.

Testing assembler debug mode now just outputs debug files (fixed #43)

RTL translation of CAL mnemonic now uses JMP instead of JIF TRU

TestHash now accepts any capitalization of exit and q to quit

Changed INC and DEC to not set flags, and added ICC and DCC mnemonics to set flags (fixed #33)

Went back and edited + re-assembled all files with INC and DEC

Fixed problem with ASCII file encoder not running the FTLV1.py script

Turned off the "load on start" feature that Digital uses to automatically update firmware & software. This would cause issues on other people's computers with different directories.

Fixed critical issue with Self Assembler not working (AssembleNext had a typo)


COMPLETELY changed how empty arrays work. They are now treated like references, for example:
 
@MY_LIST_SIZE = 23
MyList = ~MY_LIST_SIZE

The size MUST come before its usage. This was really hard to get working, but resolves #34
