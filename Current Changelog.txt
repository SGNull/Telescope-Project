LATEST CHANGES:

Added gitignore.

Corrected TBOS pause code.

Rewrote ModifyBits code.

Hugely improved FindOpenMemory (the logic was not nearly as difficult as I remember it being).

Added clarification to Glass CPU documentation about bit masking with SET, UST, SLB, and SRB operations.

Added stack pushing & popping to all functions except the LoadProgramX's in TBOS. Minor slowdowns, but nothing too significant. Data in optimization notes (data for post-optimization will be replaced once stack pushing and popping is fully implemented). Brief Summary: I'm not sure that I like these numbers, and I'm not sure if I'm going to stick with this change.
