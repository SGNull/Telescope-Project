LATEST CHANGES:

Went back and revised some comments/documentation to refresh myself on this project, and to make things (hopefully) much clearer.

Resolved #48 - Made the bootloader machine that should have been made from the start. In retrospect, the original bootloader was a good test of TASL, but still, the solution was right there.

Testing Assembler correctly uses warnings now.

Created a much better drive imager script.

Created a drive image inspector script for seeing what is inside each TSFS drive. Currently can only show the raw data of subdirectories, and is not configured to display actual text/instructions/etc. Still rather useful for seeing what types of files are stored in a drive.

Resolved #49 - Created a button in N++ for the drive imager. This runs on the currently opened file's directory.
