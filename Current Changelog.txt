LATEST CHANGES:

Fixed bug where, if only root was running, the OS would think a deadlock has occurred.

Slight optimization in Dispatcher saving 2 cycles per loop (LDI is done outside and not inside loop).

Added MaxProcID to optimize Dispatcher. Resolves #70

Added MAX_DISPATCH_CYCLES to adjust how many times Dispatcher will loop through ProcList.

Did some basic math to figure out how much of an optimization MaxProcID is (and it's a big one when just a few procs are running). See "Optimization Notes.txt" for more details.
