A large majority of files in the Telescope Project have been refactored, updated, edited, moved, or trimmed to be more coherent and sensible. There are two goals that this is in service of: 

	1. For the user experience to be much cleaner at all levels of the project.
	
	2. To increase project development speed overall.

Some of these changes include:

	- TBOS.tasl minor comment rewording
	
	- Linguist ignores less files
	
	- npes_saved.txt Rewrite
	
	- New N++ startup script
	
	- NPPExec scripts changed to reflect Python script changes
	
	- README.md has been tweaked
	
	- N++ setup document now has TASL dark mode info
	
	- New Project Examples document
	
	- Software folders renamed to have TASL in their name

	- .tload.hex and .table, renamed to .tld.hex and .tabl respectively
	
	- Ideas.txt has new ideas and a much better format
	
	- ASCII Hex Encoder now outputs to console
	
	- TASL UDL's now use transparency consistantly
	
	- TASL Library is now inside of TASL Software
	
	- gitignore tweaked to ignore directories better.

Python scripts have gone through major changes and are now properly divided into modules. Some of these changes include:

	- The cross-assembler has been split into its 4 constituent parts: Assembler simulation, CA extra features, CLI, and script interface.

	- Added read_text_as_ascii and normalized_hex to the hex_interface module.

	- Many scripts now use the hex_interface module

	- file_paths module was created for functions that os.path does not contain, but are commonly used.

Created the TASL Bundler script    ****STILL NEEDS TESTING****




Changed in this commit (included above):

Reworked changelog. Probably needs to be condensed even more.

Added extra details to the ideas file and the project examples file.

Correctly moved the TASL Library into the TASL Software folder.

Fixed remaining transparency issues in TASL UDLs.

Changed .table files to .tabl

In hex_interface, normalized_hex now takes signed integers.

Added console outputs to the ASCII Hex Encoder.

Adjusted the console outputs of the assembler_interface and enhanced_assembler to look nicer.

Fixed bug in the enhanced_assembler where it could not properly handle negative numbers in source code.

All source code files are now at most 2 directories deep inside of the TASL Software directory.

Changed .gitignore to properly ignore certain directories.
