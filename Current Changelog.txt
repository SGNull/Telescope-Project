LATEST CHANGES:

Bit shifting *carry logic* now supports 5-bit inputs, handles inputs greater than 16 properly, and now actually works correctly. No, it apparently did not work correctly before this fix, all shifts had 1 added to them.

Wrote test script for detecting shift carry logic issues.

The TBOS Testing sandbox now has the shifter logic check running by default.
