LATEST CHANGES:

Completely changed ProcList to remove the requirement for calculations. In hindsight, this is an incredibly obvious solution. Did not remove WAIT or ACTIVE bits from SupportList, because it speeds up the dispatcher significantly.

Rewrote a ton of code in TBOS (most of the source code has now been written recently).

Removed old files (no reason to keep them when using Git).

Added IO Wait Write and IO Wait Read syscalls. Resolves #61.

Moved and simplified syscall descriptions in TBOS source code.

Added IO Wait bit to support words. Resolves #76.

Added TBOS v2.3 test speeds to Optimization Notes.
