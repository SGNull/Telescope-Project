LATEST CHANGES:

Minor change to the wording of TBOS.tasl documentation.

Added some OS ideas to the Ideas.txt file.

Reduced number of Linguist ignored files.

Completely rewrote the npes_saved.txt file to make modifying it far easier.

Created a startup script for N++.

Began side-work on N++ IDE UI Changes.

Python modules are in "Modules" and are named like 'my_module_thing'. Scripts meant to be ran via CLI are named like 'My Python Script'.

The Python cross-assembler interface code has been dramatically rewritten to be much easier to read.

Many Python scripts now utilize the hex_interface module.

Updated Assembler Test files to reflect the current cross-assembler's output



The Python cross-assembler is now split into 4 separate scripts:
	The assembler simulation is its own module. It is *just* the assembler simulation.
	The extra features that come with the Python cross-assembler are in their own module on top of the simulation.
	The command line interface is in its own module on top of the extra features.
	The cross-assembler script just calls the interface module with the given command line args.
	
Finished the TASL Bundler script  **NEED TO TEST STILL**

Renamed .tload.hex files to just .tld.hex for convenience.

Corrected the .table file output to be just .tabl. **Must be corrected for all files and for TASL.**

Created the file_paths.py module for functions that os.path does not contain, but are commonly used.

Updated NPPExec scripts to reflect Python script changes.

Added read_text_as_ascii and normalized_hex to the hex_interface module.

ASCII Hex Encoder and Test Hash now use the hex_interface and enhanced_assembler modules respectively.

Added dark mode information to the N++ setup document.

Tweaked the README.md

Renamed the software folders to have TASL in their name.

Created the project examples document. I was going to put something like this in the README because it is very much necessary, but it felt like it needed to be its own document with multiple examples.
