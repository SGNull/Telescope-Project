LATEST CHANGES:

Finished the Comprehensive Threading Test. (Mostly) resolves #64

TBOS can now run the threading test successfully!

Slight hardware changes.


--- OS Fixes ---

Rewrote some code to use LOD's address value, rather than add it to the offset register.

Implemented further MaxProcNum optimizations.

Terminate now completely zeros out the proc's main word (it's slightly faster).

Fixed bug where OS would not get HLB or FLG correctly for OOB checks.

Fixed bug in Verhogen and Passeren where the process support word would not be properly updated.

Fixed bug in Terminate where it would not remove a proc's SemAdd or SemNo.

Fixed bug in Passeren where it would write the support word to the wrong memory location.

Fixed bug where child threads would not have their support words marked correctly.

Fixed bug where I/O Mutex and I/O Release did not V or P the I/O semaphores.

Fixed the initialization of I/O mutex semaphores.

Fixed bug in RemoveChild where a process, if it was a sibling, would not be bridged over properly in the proc tree.

Removed the I/O mutex semaphores from the list of soft block semaphores.


--- Hardware Changes ---

Further refined the CPU's I/O signals (I can't believe they STILL flicker)

Added CPU HLT breakpoint to the TCS.

Removed PAUS Mode pin on TCS. Now has seperate Pause CPU and PAUS interrupt pins. Details were added to the pins for clarification.
