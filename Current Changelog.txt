The first macro! Resolves #14 (but it's hardcoded into the assembler)

CAL - MOV RA PC; ALI ADD RA 4; JIF TRU



Changed "Commands" to just multi-line comments, because that's what they really are right now.

Resolved #8 by adding the ability to provide -c to the Python assembler. Note: You cannot run both -c and -d at the same time.

Updated the custom buttons file with the new compressor.

Exported the TASL3 UDL file.
