Python modules are in "Modules" and are named my_module_thing. Scripts meant to be ran via CLI are named My Python Script.

The Python assembler simulation is its own module, and the added features on top of the assembler are their own module, and the CLI interface is a normal Python script. Was a bit tricky pulling apart my old code, but managed to get it to work first try (ominous).

The Python cross-assembler interface code has been dramatically rewritten to be much easier to read.

Many Python scripts now utilize the hex_interface module.

Updated Assembler Test files to reflect the current cross-assembler's output

Updated NPPExec scripts to reflect Python script changes.
