LATEST CHANGES:

Sped up OS initialization by not clearing the bootloader from the end of memory (there was no need to do that anyways).

Resolved #47; Finished and renamed the Python drive imager script.

Resolved #10 finally! Realized it's not very helpful. Currently unsued (and probably unecessary. The Telescope Computer's drive system operates almost identically to the Assembler Computer's input and output).
