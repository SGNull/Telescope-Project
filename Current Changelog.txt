Major file structure and documentation refactoring.

Created completely new directories.

Updated the N++ UDL files.

Updated the N++ walkthrough to be more general.

Removed empty files.

Moved documentation inside directories relating to the object of documentation, rather than having a seperate "Docs" file.

Added a "Current Changelog" file to keep track of changes that are made. This file should be cleared just before committing, and it's contents should be copied to the commit description.

Added an "Ideas" file to keep track of ideas that come up now and then which are not polished enough to be their own issues or have their own seperate docs.
