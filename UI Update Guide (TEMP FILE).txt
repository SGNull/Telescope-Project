1. Python scripts are interfaced with through the console with as few arguments as necessary, and intuitive launch options are given through NPPExec scripts. (Easy)
2. Create a shared set of Python modules that each Python script uses. (DONE!)
3. Normalize Python script names. (DONE!)
4. See if making an install script is possible. (nope, not doing it)
5. Finish making the U/I diagrams *if I want to*. (probably will. It's helpful)
6. Make the Python Import & Assemble script. (In progress...)
