(% Writes keyboard 1 input to terminal 1
   
   Reader will wait and read keyboard 1
   Writer will wait and write what its given to terminal 1
   
   This is easier said than done.
   Reader will read keyboard 1, then write the result out TNET 1
   Writer will read TNET 2 and write what it gets to the terminal
   Main will wait on TNET 3 to recieve anything, and if it does it halts
   Let's hope it works!!
