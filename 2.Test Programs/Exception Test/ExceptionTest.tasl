/ A simple test of exceptions, HLT, LDI, RSM and SYS
/ We load some values into EXA, EPC, and FLG.
/ Then, we use RSM to jump to FakePoint as a user process. 
/ This memory location has all 0's by default, so it's like a user attempting to HLT.
/ This should cause a PRIV exception, along with an OOB and CTDZ.
/ Then the CPU will jump to ExHandler to resolve the exceptions.
/ ExHandler will then use a syscall to jump to the end point.
/ The RAM should end on "600D".
