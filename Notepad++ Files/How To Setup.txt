In C:\Program Files\Notepad++
	copy 'plugins' into it
	copy 'functionList' into it (will alter 'overrideMap')

In %APPDATA%\Notepad++
	copy 'userDefineLangs' into it
	copy 'themes' into it
	
	copy 'config' into the 'plugins' folder
		IMPORTANT: In 'npe_saved.txt' inside 'config' at the top of the document, replace the SCRIPTS_PATH file path!



If you do not see the custom TASL buttons:
	Open N++ and click "Plugins" -> "Customize Toolbar" -> "Custom Buttons"

If you do not see .tasl file language highlighting:
	Open N++ and click "Language" -> "User Defined Language" -> "Define your Language" -> "Import"
	In the project directory, import "Notepad++ Files\userDefineLangs\TASL X.xml"

For turning dark mode on and off:
	Only go to "Settings" > "Preferences" > "Dark Mode" (on the left)
	Now select either the "Light mode" or "Dark mode" buttons.
	Close and re-open N++.
	I recommend going to the "Define your Language" menu and removing the version you don't want.
