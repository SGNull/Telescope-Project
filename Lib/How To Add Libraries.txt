Preserve all register states
If no conditional branching is used, use AIF and ALF to preserve flags without pushing to stack
Use AIF always when pushing/popping stack to preserve flags

Always use RG0-RGX as the input
Always use RG6 as the output
Always use RG7 as the return address

Avoid unnecessarily costly actions
Remember that STR/LOD use 3 clock cycles, the most of any instruction
JIF use 2 clock cycles when true, but only 1 if false
LDI uses 2 clock cycles
MOV and ALU use 1 clock cycle
