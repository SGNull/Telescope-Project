In Desmos:
	Found a perfect solution for cycles/character (including $) pre-optimization:
	f(x) = 905x + 2454
	For x = number of characters, f(x) = cycles

	2454 cycles to start and stop no matter what:
		Not including boot
		Including Main's negligable initial time spent syscalling
		Including OS startup time
		Including OS loading program time
		Including OS shutdown time

	905 cycles per character:
		Including Dispatcher loop time
		Including negligable time spent reading/writing/waiting by programs
		Including ExHandler and Dispatcher loading and storing proc states
	
	
	
	Found a perfect solution for cycles/character (including $) post-optimization:
	f(x) = 514x + 2537
	
	2537 cycles is our new base amount of cycles.
		Very very good! Only a minor, negligable increase!
	
	514 cycles per character.
		This is huge! Nearly halved!
