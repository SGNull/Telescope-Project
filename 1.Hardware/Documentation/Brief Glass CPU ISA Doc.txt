Instruction set:
----------------
Instructions are formatted like:
[4-bit Instruction Code] [4-bit Modifier] [4-bit Operand 0] [4-bit Operand 1]
Some instructions require an additional 16-bit address/value after the full 16-bit instruction

0 HLT - HALT, no operands
1 RSM - Resume process in EPC, no operands
2 SYS - Syscall, no operands (can be executed with ExEn off)
3 MOV - MOV, 2 operands: write to first on left

4 JIF - Jump if, no operands w/ address, modifier=condition
5 LDI - Load immediate, 1 operand w/ value
6 LOD - RAM read, 2 operands w/ address: Address + value in right op -> left op
7 STR - RAM write, 2 operands w/ address: Left op -> Address + value in right op
For STR, if op0 = op1, no value is added to the address.
This does not happen with LOD, as it would force things like reg = array[index] to use 2 registers.

ALU ops: 2 operands, modifier = opcode: left op [operation] right op -> left op
8 ALF - setflags
9 AIF - immediate, setflags
a ALU - normal ops
b ALI - immediate

c AFN - nowrite, setflags
d AIN - immediate+nowrite, setflags
e NOP - nowrite (does nothing)
f NOP - immediate+nowrite (really does nothing)



Registers:
----------
0-5 general purpose registers RG0-5
6 OUT is RG6 (for function outputs)
7 RA is RG7  (for function return addresses)

8 PC  - Program counter
9 IO  - I/O Device (pointed to by IOP)
a FLG - Flags (x5 IOP, x3 EXC, x4 Ov Ca <0 =0, x2 prvUE, x2 curUE) (R/W ALUF & IOP only)
b SP  - Stack pointer
c HLB - HI/LO address bounds, split by byte. (generates OOB exception) (W prot., R HI only)
d CTD - Count-down timer (generates CTDZ exception) (W prot.)
e EPC - Exception return program counter (R/W prot.)
f EXA - Exception handler address (R/W prot.)



ALU Operations:
---------------
0 NOT - bitwise NOT B
1 AND - bitwise AND
2 OR  - bitwise OR
3 XOR - bitwise XOR

4 SLB - shift left by B w/ carry bit set to OR of all overflow bits
5 SRB - shift right by B w/ carry bit set to OR of all underflow bits
6 SEL - select bit B from A (returns it in the bit0 position)
7 ENC - runs B through a priority encoder

8 NEG - negate B
9 ADD - add
a ADC - add + carry
b SUB - subtract (A-B)

c SBB - subtract with borrow (A-B)
d MUL - multiply
e DIV - unsigned division (A/B)
f MOD - modulo (A%B)



Jump Conditions:
----------------
0 EQZ - Last ALU result was equal to zero
1 LTZ - Last ALU result was less than zero (sign)
2 CAR - Last ALU result generated a carry/borrow/shift over/under
3 OVR - Last ALU result had unexpected sign for signed arithmetic

4 PRD - I/O port is reading from the CPU
5 PWT - I/O port is writing to the CPU
6 TRU - Unconditional jump
7 RND - Randomly jump

8 NEZ - Last ALU result was not equal to zero
9 GEZ - Last ALU result was greater or equal to zero
a NCR - Last ALU op did not cause CAR
b NOV - Last ALU op did not cause OVR

c PNR - I/O port is not reading from the CPU
d PNW - I/O port is not writing to the CPU


Exceptions/Interrupts
---------------------
Maskable:
Maskable exceptions/interrupts are disabled when IntEn, the E in current UE, is off.
 0 INT0 - Interrupt line 0
 1 INT1 - Interrupt line 1
 2 INT2 - Interrupt line 2
 3 CTDZ - The countdown timer reached zero.

Non-Maskable:
 4 SYS  - The process requested a syscall.
 5 NMIT - Non-maskable, high priority interrupt.

Non-Ignorable:
Non-ignorable exceptions/interrupts completely block reading & writing immediately.
 6 PRIV - A user process used HLT, RSM, or triggered register protections.
 7 OOB  - A user process tried to access memory outside of its HI/LO bounds. 
 
Only the highest priority interrupt goes through at a time.
