(% Writes keyboard 1 input to terminal 1
   
   Reader will wait and read keyboard 1
   Writer will wait and write what its given to terminal 1
   All will stop when the $ character is seen
   
   More technically speaking...
   
   Reader will read keyboard 1, then write the result to TNET 1
   TNET 1 will be connected to itself to make a shared register
   Writer will read TNET 1 and write what it gets to the terminal
   
   If reader sees the $ character, it instead writes it to TNET 2 and loops forever.
   TNET 2 will also be connected to itself
   Main will wait on TNET 2 to recieve anything, and if it does it halts
   
   Main halting should terminate reader and writer, since they are its children.
   
   Let's hope it works!!
